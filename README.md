# Explore Classification Part 2
This repo is to continue exploring classification. The goal is to experiment with feature selection, dimensionality reduction, and Principle Component Analysis (PCA).

## Task 1
- Apply Fischer's Discriminant Analysis
- Apply Linear Discriminant Analysis

## Task 2
- Apply Principal Component Analysis

## Running an experiment
Use the following command: `python3 -m experiments.<dataset_folder>.<experiment_name>`

Example: `python3 -m experiments.wine_quality.linear_discriminant_analysis`
